Ques. 3. what is JDK, JRE, JVM?
Ans JDK,It is Java Development Kit.it is use for developing Java applications and Applets.
It is convert to source code to bytecode.

JRE,It is java runtime environment is software package that provides the runtime environment for java application to run.it is includes virtual machine,jre java load to bytecode into memory.

JVM, java virtual machine is a crucial component of the java ecosystem.It  is software programe that runs bytecode on the computer.it's the run time environment for java applications.
Ques. 4. what is the structure of java program. write a program to print hello world.
Ans. 1-package
     2.class
     3.import
     4.main function
     
   Program-
   class first demo1{
   public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("hello word");

                          }
                  }
       output-hello word


Ques. 5. Define Variables in java. Explain different scope of variable.
Ans.  Variable is container that we store the value of variable
     there 3 type of variable in java

    local variable(declare in a and in a function)
    static variable(in declare in class with static key word and outside the function)
    non-static variable(it is declare in class and out side the function)


Ques. 6. Define data types in java.
 ANS. There are 2 type data type in java 
     1.Premative
     2.Non-Premative

    Premative(int,long,byte,short,float,boolean double)
    Non-Premative(Array,String,class)

Ques. 7. What is type casting in java?
Ans. Type casting in java ,it is a process that is convert to data type into another data type.according to your requirment that is type casting.

Example   double-> floa->long->int->short-> byte

Ques. 8. Write a program to add two number by taking input from user.
ans-

Import Java.util.Scanner;
Public class add_twoNo.{
Public Static void main(String[ Args]){
int a;
int b;
int Sum;
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Enter the first number”);
a=sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(“Enter the Second number”);
b=sc.nextInt();
Sum=a+b;
System.out.println(Sum);
}
}

Ques. 9. Define operator and its type?

Ans. 9. An Operator is a special symbol or keyword that performs operations on one or more operands.
 Arithmetic Operators
Addition 
 2 + 3 = 5
Subtraction 
 6 - 1 = 5
Multiplication
2 * 6  = 12
Division 
 8 / 2 = 4
Modulus 
 10 % 3 = 1

Relational Operators

Equal to 
 2 == 2 : true.
Not equal 
 5 != 3 :false
Greater than 
5> 2 :true
Less than 
 1 < 5: true
Greater than or equal 
1 >= 1 : true
Less than or equal
 2 <= 3 : true
Logical Operators

AND 
(1 && 0) : false
OR
(1 || 0) : true
NOT  
1!=0: false

Assignment Operators

Assignment 
 x = 10.
Addition assignment 
 x += 4.
Subtraction assignment 
 x -= 4.
Multiplication assignment 
 x *= 4.
Division assignment 
x /= 4.
Modulus assignment 
x %= 3


Bitwise Operators

AND (&): 5 & 3 results in 1.
OR (|): 5 | 3 results in 7.
XOR (^): 5 ^ 3 results in 6.
NOT (~): ~5 results in -6.
Left shift (<<): 2 << 1 results in 4.
Right shift (>>): 4 >> 1 results in 2.

Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Ternary (?:): (a > b) ? a : b.
Unary Operators
Unary plus (+): +5 = 5.
Unary minus (-): -5 = -5.
Increment (++): x++.
Decrement (--): x--.
Logical NOT (!): !true = false.

Ques. 10. Write a program individually to perform operators operation.
Ans.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class OperatorOperations {

    public static void performOperations(double a, double b) {
        // Addition
        double addition = a + b;
        System.out.println("Addition: " + a + " + " + b + " = " + addition);

        // Subtraction
        double subtraction = a - b;
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + a + " - " + b + " = " + subtraction);

        // Multiplication
        double multiplication = a * b;
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + a + " * " + b + " = " + multiplication);

        // Division
        if (b != 0) {
            double division = a / b;
            System.out.println("Division: " + a + " / " + b + " = " + division);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division: Cannot divide by zero.");
        }

        // Modulus
        if (b != 0) {
            double modulus = a % b;
            System.out.println("Modulus: " + a + " % " + b + " = " + modulus);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Modulus: Cannot compute modulus by zero.");
        }

        // Exponentiation
        double exponentiation = Math.pow(a, b);
        System.out.println("Exponentiation: " + a + " ^ " + b + " = " + exponentiation);

        // Floor Division (using integer division)
        if (b != 0) {
            int floorDivision = (int) a / (int) b;
            System.out.println("Floor Division: " + (int) a + " // " + (int) b + " = " + floorDivision);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Floor Division: Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input numbers
        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Perform operations
        performOperations(num1, num2);

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
